## Applications of AI

This is the repository of some JupyterNotebooks project when I study the course of Applications of Artificial Intelligent at HCMUT. During this course, I have done programming the fundamental algorithm of some most common
machine learning algorithms in Python, as well as how to use available libraries for deep learning algorithms. This repository includes some of the following algorithm

- KNN
- Naive Bayes
- PCA
- LDA
- Decision Tree
- Logistic Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Cross Validation
